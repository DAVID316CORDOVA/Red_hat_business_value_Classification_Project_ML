# Red_hat_business_value_Classification_Project_ML
The object of this project is to predict the potential business value of a person who has performed a specific activity. The business value outcome is defined by a yes/no field attached to each unique activity in the activity file. The outcome field indicates whether or not each person has completed the outcome within a fixed window of time after each unique activity was performed. The activity file contains several different categories of activities. Type 1 activities are different from type 2-7 activities because there are more known characteristics associated with type 1 activities (nine in total) than type 2-7 activities (which have only one associated characteristic).
